# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Content must be clear and accessible to university-level students; All explanations include foundational concepts before advanced topics; Theory-first approach with practical examples that illustrate concepts without requiring actual implementation.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All content must be based on official documentation and credible sources; Technical information verified against current standards and best practices; Regular review of content to ensure alignment with evolving technologies in Physical AI, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA systems.

### III. Theory-First Approach
Focus on conceptual understanding over implementation details; Commands and setups described for illustrative purposes only, clearly marked as examples; All practical content serves to reinforce theoretical concepts rather than stand alone.

### IV. Comprehensive Coverage
Content must cover all specified domains: Physical AI foundations, ROS 2 theory, Gazebo/Unity concepts, NVIDIA Isaac workflows, VLA systems, humanoid robotics, hardware overview, cloud compute options, robot lab options, and weekly learning plan; Weekly learning modules structured to build knowledge progressively with clear learning outcomes.

### V. Structural Integrity
Book built with Docusaurus framework for consistent navigation and presentation; Proper document hierarchy with clear cross-references between related topics; Consistent formatting, clean typography, and accessible presentation standards maintained throughout.

### VI. Quality and Accuracy
All content must be factually accurate, well-researched, and properly cited; No fabricated examples or misleading information; Content undergoes rigorous review for technical correctness and educational value.

## Additional Constraints

Technology Stack: Docusaurus for documentation, GitHub Pages for deployment, Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus for development workflow.
Content Scope: 12–14 chapters plus appendices, 20,000–30,000 words total.
Deployment: Static site deployment to GitHub Pages with proper navigation and search functionality.
Performance: Optimized for fast loading and smooth navigation, with proper image compression and asset optimization.

## Development Workflow

Content Creation: All chapters and sections follow the established template and structure.
Review Process: Each chapter undergoes technical review for accuracy and educational effectiveness.
Quality Gates: Content must meet educational standards, technical accuracy, and structural requirements before approval.
Testing: Documentation site builds successfully with no broken links or formatting issues.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book development; All content, structure, and technical decisions must align with these principles; Amendments require explicit documentation and approval process; All contributors must acknowledge and follow these principles.

All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with educational excellence and technical accuracy; Content complexity must be justified by educational value; Use this constitution as the primary guidance document for all development decisions.
