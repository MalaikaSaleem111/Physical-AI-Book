# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This comprehensive guide covers the fundamentals of Physical AI, humanoid robotics, ROS 2 concepts, simulation environments, and advanced systems.

## Overview

This book is structured as follows:

- **Part I**: Foundations in Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- **Part II**: Development frameworks including ROS 2 and simulation environments
- **Part III**: Advanced systems like NVIDIA Isaac and VLA systems
- **Part IV**: Humanoid Robotics
- **Part V**: Supporting Content
- **Part VI**: Weekly Learning Modules & Outcomes

Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge, providing a systematic learning path for university students, early researchers, and beginners in the field.

## Learning Path

The book includes weekly learning modules designed to be completed over a 12-13 week period, with each week focusing on specific concepts and building toward a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics and Physical AI.

All examples in this book are conceptual, focusing on theory rather than requiring hardware or software setup.
