  Book — "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

  Target audience:
  University students, early researchers, and beginners learning Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and simulation ecosystems.

  Focus:
  A clear, theory-only book covering Physical AI foundations, humanoid robot fundamentals, ROS 2 concepts, Gazebo/Unity simulation principles, NVIDIA Isaac workflows, VLA systems, and weekly learning modules.

  Success criteria:
  - 8–12 chapter book, 20,000–30,000 words
  - Accurate, structured, and based on credible/official sources
  - Theory-first: all examples are conceptual, not executable
  - Includes weekly topics, fundamentals, and simulation concepts
  - Builds cleanly in Docusaurus with working navigation and sidebar
  - Original, cohesive, university-level explanation throughout

  Constraints:
  - Format: Markdown for Docusaurus
  - Tone: clear, educational, technically correct
  - No hardware or software setups required for understanding
